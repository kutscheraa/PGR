Mini photo editor
=============
#### *Computer graphics class assignment*
### Description

-------

##### Main purporse was to make simple photo editor using C# and learn 2D/3D graphics algorithms. I choosed plain JS instead, which I wouldnt recommend to anyone, since its quite limiting to implement complex functions.
##### The whole app was made in under 4 hours, without prior JS knowledge.
